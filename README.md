ELORA PLM COMPILE PROCEDURE
===========================

Work in progress procedure for building ELORA PLM

Tested in the following environment:

Description:    
* Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* git version 2.20.1
* /bin/sh -> dash version 0.5.10.2-5
* docker-compose version 1.25.5 (installed via pip3 install)
* docker version 19.03.8 build afacb8b7f0

The build should work on a fresh system, but it can be troublesome in systems in which it has already been run. It is still a work in progress.

It's more of a documented step by step instruction set of the steps to follow in order to build all the dependencies needed for building Elora PLM.

Entry point is build.sh
